# dissertation-tudelft-latex

This is a fork of the TU Delft LaTeX dissertation template found at https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-corporate-design/downloads/.

The main changes in this document are that the folders are reorganized and made more git-ready.

These documents, as they exist, are still highly dependent on many font packages that TeXShop or some other large version of TeX comes with, but I am running it with BasicTeX. In my own repo, which I will eventually make public, I have made other modifications to the fonts, layout, and of course, content.
